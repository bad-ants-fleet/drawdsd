# drawdsd -- SVG images of domain-level complexes 

Tired of drawing domain-level complexes by hand? Tired of automatically
generated images that are *almost* exactly like you want them? Try this.

## Install
```sh
    pip install .
```

## Quickstart
A good starting point is the [examples] directory. You can find a Jupyter
notebook [examples.ipynb] to learn about the most important drawing features.
There are also input files that can be visualized using the command line tool
*drawDSD*. It is probably worth looking at the code of this script, which 
can be found in the file drawdsd/iosetup.py

## Version
 - v0.3: 

### TODO:
 - provide visualization of single strands?
